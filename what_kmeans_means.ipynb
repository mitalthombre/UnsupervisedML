Specify the number of clusters *K*. There are ways in which you can find the number of clusters and we are going to look at that tomorrow. For today, we use our \"intuition\" to select a number. \n","2.   Select *K* points at random: we need to start somewhere so we start by selecting 3 points at random that will act as our **centroids***. These points don't necessarily have to be any of our data points.\n","3. Start creating the clusters: to do this, we measure the distance between each of our data points and each of our centroids. We assign each data point to the closest centroid. \n","4. Compute new centroids for each cluster. \n","5. Calculate the within-cluster variation (calculate the total variance of each cluster). \n","6. Repeat steps 3-5. The stopping criteria is up to whoever is running the algorithm, but it is usually the number of iterations. The [default value for k-means using sklearn is 300](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html). You can also use convergence; we say that an algorithm has converged when the progress between iterations is non-existent or minimal. \n","7. This is done 10 times with SKLearn by default, but this can be changed. The clusters with the least within-cluster variation (formally known as Within-Cluster Sum of Squares or WCSS for whoever wants to check out the formula) are then chosen to be the \"best\" clusters.
